# Description
I found a web app that can help process images: PNG images only!

# Solution
- I try upload 1 file php :
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/PEQi6OF.png">

- It thrown me an error that the file name doesn't contain '.png' in it. So I just renamed the file to test.png.php, and tried uploading the file

- But it didn't show where the file file was uploaded. So I used ffuf enumerating directories.([ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf))

- From the results of the above command, found a directory called uploads.The file was uploaded successfully

- Shell execute

- List the files in the current folder

-Because we are in the uploads folder, we only see the files we upload. Try returning to the previous folder to see?
