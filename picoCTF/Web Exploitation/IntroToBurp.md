Try here to find the flag

- Hint : Try mangling the request, maybe their server-side code doesn't handle malformed requests very well.
- So if we just remove the otp parameter before forwarding the request then?
Well then the site just keep loading. It didn’t work. But then i realised, maybe it required some parameter, not necessarily ‘otp’. So instead of the ‘OTP’ parameter, i renamed it with something like, ‘int’. And I received the flag
