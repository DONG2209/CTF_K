# Description
The flag is somewhere on this web application not necessarily on the website. Find it.

# Solution
- Every time you visit a website, you should review the robots.txt file.
- Or you can directories scan : [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf.git)
  http://saturn.picoctf.net:62652/robots.txt
```
User-agent *
Disallow: /cgi-bin/
Think you have seen your flag or want to keep looking.

Disallow: /wp-admin/
```
- We can see, that the gibberish inside looks like base64 code, so using [CyberChef](https://cyberchef.org/) we can decode:
```
flag1.txt;js/myfi
js/myfile.txt
```
- Now go to url : http://saturn.picoctf.net:62652/js/myfile.txt
