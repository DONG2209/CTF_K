# Description
Can you get the flag?
We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag?

# Solution
- Use a relative path to get up to / and then access flag.txt: ../../../../flag.txt.
- We know to go up 4 directories because /usr/share/nginx/html/ is 4 subdirectories from / . However, it may be more ../ because it is using relative path
```
filename=../../../../../../flag.txt
```
