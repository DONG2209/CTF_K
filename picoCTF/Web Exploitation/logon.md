# Description
The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as Joe and find what they've been looking at? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/13594/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:13594

# Solution
- I try input username=test  & password=test
- That there is three cookies:
    A cookie named admin with the value False
    A cookie named username with the value test
    A cookie named password with the value test
- Edit the admin cookie's value and set it to True and then reload the web page (press F5). Now the web page displays the flag.
- If you want to automate the retrieval of the flag you can use curl like this:
```bash
$ curl --cookie "admin=True" https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/13594/flag | grep -oE 'picoCTF{.*}'
picoCTF{th3_c0nsp1r4cy_l1v3s_d1c24fef}
```
