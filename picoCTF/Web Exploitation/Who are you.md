# Solution
- When I visit the site, it says
```
Only people who use the official PicoBrowser are allowed on this site!
```
- I hide the default User-Agent field and override the default User-Agent to PicoBrowser

- Now, I need to make the title show it comes from the same website. I will use the Referer key with the website value(http://mercury.picoctf.net:36622/)

- I'll use the Date header with any value from 2018, for example "Mon, 1 Jan 2018 00:00:00 GMT"

- Adjust the Do-Not-Track Header: Add the DNT field to the request header and set its value to 1 to request not to be tracked

- The message 'This website is only for people from Sweden.' indicates that the website is checking the geographical location based on information from the HTTP request. To bypass this check, I tried changing the X-Forwarded-For field to simulate an IP address from Sweden (for example: 85.230.0.0) . [Link ip Sweden](https://lite.ip2location.com/sweden-ip-address-ranges)

- I use the Accept-Language header to specify which languages are ok
