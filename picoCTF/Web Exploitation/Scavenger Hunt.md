# Description
There is some interesting information hidden around this site http://mercury.picoctf.net:5080/. Can you find it?

# Solution
- Check index file ,I see first part of the flag :
```
<!-- Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t -->
```
- Continue, on mycss.css file I see second part of the flag:
```
/* CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0 */
```
- - Next, I check myjs.js. The JS file reveals:
```
/* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */
```
- I searched up  "How can I keep Google from indexing my website? " and I received [the post](https://support.thinkific.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030362134-How-do-I-stop-Google-from-indexing-my-site) . I think it's possible a robots exclusion file (robots.txt) might have something
I access: http://mercury.picoctf.net:5080/robots.txt
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /index.html
# Part 3: t_0f_pl4c
# I think this is an apache server... can you Access the 
next flag?
```
=> Alright! The comments give part 3 of the flag 
- The .htacess file manages Apache server permissions. Replacing robots.txt with .htaccess got this
http://mercury.picoctf.net:5080/.htaccess
```
# Part 4: 3s_2_lO0k
# I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.
```
=> Oh! The comments give part 4 of the flag 
- What stands out the most about that hint is the capitalized "Store". In Macs, a .DS_Store file stores the configurations for how the desktop looks (eg. icon location, etc.) Changing .htacess with .DS_Store got
http://mercury.picoctf.net:5080/.DS_Store
```
Congrats! You completed the scavenger hunt. Part 5: _35844447}
