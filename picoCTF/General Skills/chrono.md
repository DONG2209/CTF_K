# Solution
- I searched the web for "How to automate tasks to run at intervals on linux servers?" and got the result: crontab . I realized that it was referring to cron tasks, which are stored in the /etc/crontab file. I used cat /etc/crontab/ to find the flag:
```
picoplayer@challenge:/$ cat /etc/crontab
