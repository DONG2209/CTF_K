# Solution
- We can see that the cost is negative, even though it was entered as 9999999999999 multiplied by 900, which is 2147483647â€”the maximum value of an `int` in C. Therefore, the multiplication causes an integer overflow and the cost becomes negative. Since we subtract a negative cost, we end up with a positive number. That's why we can purchase the flag now.
